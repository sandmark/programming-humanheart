Programming Human-Heart
-----------------------

An implementation of a book named [Programming Human Heart ~Let's build a ChatterBot with Ruby](https://books.google.com/books?id=oaK_BQAAQBAJ)(Japanese), written in Ruby.

## Why chatterbot in this modern era?

The author, TOMOTOSHI Akiyama who made a chatting software TAKIBI, is gone in 36 years old on 18 Feb, 2005. However, his skills and techniques has been left by himself like this. Making and tweaking my own chatter bot AI is one of my very best dreams since I was just a little lad..., "if I had a my own (weak) AI, what could I do for *him*?" I wondered and dreamed, countless times.

This book will teach HOWTOs of making chatter bot to readers. For me, that should be my second heart.

Implementing this in other languages or tweaking harder in Ruby? It'll be shown in the near future.

Thanks to Akiyama-san, rest in peace.
